# pl-lens-macros

This is a temporary crate used to implement the `lens!` procedural macro, which requires
the `proc-macro-hack` crate until such a time that procedural macros are officially
supported in expression position.

This crate is automatically re-exported by the `pl-lens` crate, so you generally
don't need to work with it directly.
